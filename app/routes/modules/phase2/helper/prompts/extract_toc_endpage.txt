You are given the raw text of several pages from a document. Your job is to determine exactly which 0-based page index marks the end of the Table of Contents (ToC).

Use these rules:

1. The ToC begins on the page that contains the line “TABLE OF CONTENTS” (case‐insensitive).  
2. Every genuine ToC entry ends with a page number at the end of the line.  
   - For example:  
     ```
     SCHEDULE 1 – EOI PARTICIPANT DETAILS  4
     SCHEDULE 2 – COMPLIANCE CRITERIA  8
     ```  
   - If a line ends with one or more digits (possibly preceded by spaces), treat it as a ToC entry.
3. The ToC ends on the last page that contains only lines ending in page‐numbers (i.e., every schedule title in that page ends with a number).  
4. As soon as you reach a page where a schedule heading appears without a trailing page number (for example, “SCHEDULE 1 – EOI PARTICIPANT DETAILS” with no digit at the end), treat that page as the start of body content. In other words, the “toc_end_page” is the previous page index.
5. Ignore any repeated identical headings that appear on a new page without trailing numbers—they always indicate the start of body text, not additional ToC entries.
6. If you cannot locate any clear ToC entries or cannot determine where the ToC ends, return 0.

Respond with **exactly** valid JSON in this format:

{
  "toc_end_page": int
}

# Important:
- Return **only** `{ "toc_end_page": <integer> }` with no extra text.
- The index is 0-based (i.e., if the ToC ends on the third page, return `2`).
